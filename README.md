  ### Usage
  
  When the user visits the deployed site, they are brought to a landing screen that allows them to create a note by clicking on the "get started" button. From there, users may add as many new notes as they wish. Clicking on the floppy disk icon in the upper right corner of the screen saves the note, which will persist regardless of whether the page is refreshed or if the user navigates away from the app. If the user wishes to delete a note, they may do so by clicking on the red trash can icon by the corresponding note.

  ### Credits
  [This](https://medium.com/@nnamani.ezinne/simple-note-taking-app-using-node-js-and-ejs-4899321a3342) tutorial was particularly helpful when it came to explaining how to build a node.js and Express app. The Heroku Dev center was also a great resource when I ran into a minor issue while deploying the app.
